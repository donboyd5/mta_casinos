Then there are dueling Queens proposals from Mets owner Steve Cohen and Hard Rock International for a [location near Citi Field](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/01/citi-field-bronx-casinos-win-support/) and another from Genting Group to [expand Resorts World New York City](https://qns.com/2025/06/resorts-world-submits-5-5-billion-plan/) next to Aqueduct Racetrack.

A fourth finalist, MGM Resorts International, last week [abruptly pulled its bid](https://abc7ny.com/post/mgm-unexpectedly-withdraws-casino-bid-empire-city-yonkers-mayor-mike-spano-calls-investigation/18007546/) to significantly expand operations at the Yonkers Raceway, where it operates the Empire City Casino, a so-called racino with 4,700 slot machines and electronic table games. The company pinned the decision to withdraw on shifts to the “competitive and economic assumptions underpinning our application,” which altered the company’s anticipated return on its proposed investment.

The MTA is depending on a timely casino licensing process by the State which is expected to bring in \$500 million annually during 2026 and 2027, \$600 million in 2028 and \$200 million in 2029.

The MTA also has identified a risk in the timing of receipt of casino revenue, as the financial plan relies on \$500 million from casinos in both 2026 and 2027, \$600 million in 2028 and \$200 million in 2029. The decision on approving the casinos is expected by the end of 2025. Any delay in the approval would lead to a delay in the MTA receiving license fee revenue and then recurring gaming tax revenue — opening potential budget gaps.
