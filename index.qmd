Casinos – per 11/3/2025 conversation w/Jai Patel

-   How much revenue to MTA assuming 3 casinos are licensed in NYC and evolve over time
-   Resorts World had recent article \$2.5b to MTA over next 4 years
-   Rough MTA/DOB assumptions appear to have been \$1.8m 1st 4 years (?):
    -   2026 \$500m – casino \# 1 NYC licensed, \$500m fee to MTA
    -   2027 \$500m - casino \# 2 NYC licensed, \$500m fee to MTA
    -   2028 \$600m
        -   casino #3 licensed, \$500m to MTA
        -   casino #1 \$100m tax revenue to MTA
    -   2029 \$200m
        -   casino #2 \$100m revenue
        -   casino #1 \$100m revenue
    -   2030+ \$300m annual (+ growth)
        -   casino tax revenu \$100m x 3 casinos = \$300m

Table from Jai, prepared by MTA staff:

The State Fiscal Year 2023-24 Enacted Budget (S4008C/A3008C, chapter 58 of the laws of 2023) included legislation providing a new stream of casino tax revenue to the MTA. The revenues are expected to be generated from casinos built in the downstate region in the future.

However, the MTA was provided only a portion of the total expected taxes, with the remainder being shared with the local governments hosting the casinos and being allocated for state education aid.

The below chart explains the portion of future revenues due to the MTA depending on where the casinos are ultimately licensed. New York state is allowed to authorize up to three casinos in the downstate region.
