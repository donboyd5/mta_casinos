New York State Fiscal Year 2023-24 Enacted Budget (S4008C/A3008C, chapter 58 of 2023)

## Summary of Legislation

-   The FY 2023-24 budget dedicates revenues from new downstate casino licenses, with an expected minimum license fee of \$500 million per facility, to the MTA.[[**assembly.state+1**]{.underline}](https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A3008C&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y)​

-   Additionally, a percentage (approximately 50%) of ongoing gaming tax revenue from these casinos will be directed to the MTA, with the remainder going to other state purposes such as education funding.[[**cbcny+1**]{.underline}](https://cbcny.org/research/what-look-mtas-november-2023-financial-plan)​

>Casino revenues—from both licenses and taxes—are a gamble. The three downstate licenses could be awarded as early as 2026, but the timing and outcome of the complicated selection and implementation process are far from certain. The MTA’s July 2023 Financial Plan assumes one license will be awarded annually in 2026 and 2027, generating $500 million in revenue per license, the statutory minimum license fee. While the amount may be certain, and perhaps could even be higher, licenses may be awarded more slowly, delaying the revenue. CBC reflects this risk as an average of $250 million annually in 2026 and 2027, due to the possibility that one of the two licenses is awarded after 2027. Furthermore, the State’s rescue plan directs a portion of the expected ongoing gaming tax revenue to stabilize the MTA’s finances after 2027. That amount also is uncertain and will be a future risk.[@wagner_champeny_2023_mta_plan]

-   All revenue collected from the license fees are deposited monthly, without further appropriation, directly into the MTA’s commercial gaming revenue fund.[[**legislation.nysenate+1**]{.underline}](https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2023/s4008c)​

-   Renewal license fees are calculated based on assessment costs, and these revenues also contribute to the MTA fund.[[**assembly.state**]{.underline}](https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A3008C&term=2023&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Committee%26nbspVotes=Y&Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y)​

## Estimates of License Fee, Tax, and Other Revenue

-   The State anticipated a one-time total of at least \$1.5 billion from the issuance of three downstate casino licenses (minimum \$500 million per license).[[**osc.ny+1**]{.underline}](https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/reports/budget/pdf/enacted-budget-report-2023-24.pdf)​

-   MTA budget documents projected about \$1.8 billion in total from casino license fees and ongoing tax revenue to be delivered between 2026 and 2029 (approx. \$500 million annually for the first two years, \$600 million in the third, and \$200 million in the fourth).[[**prnewswire+3**]{.underline}](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/resorts-world-new-york-city-projects-2-5-billion-to-mta-in-next-four-years-exceeding-budgeted-casino-revenue-of-1-8-billion-302601253.html)[@rw_nyc_2025_mta]​

-   Resorts World New York City’s recent forecast ups the anticipated revenue to \$2.5 billion for the MTA alone over four years, assuming a \$600 million upfront license fee and \$1.9 billion in tax payments, reflecting potentially higher contributions than originally budgeted.[[**morningstar+3**]{.underline}](https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20251031la12512/resorts-world-new-york-city-projects-25-billion-to-mta-in-next-four-years-exceeding-budgeted-casino-revenue-of-18-billion)​

-   The taxes to the state and MTA are contingent on the casino opening timeline, gaming volume, and final licensing details; education is expected to receive a roughly equal share of tax revenue as transit.[[**qns**]{.underline}](https://qns.com/2025/10/resorts-world-mta/)​
