# Timetable

As of November 2025, the process for awarding up to three new downstate commercial casino licenses in New York (including NYC, Long Island, and Westchester) is nearing completion, following the timeline and regulations established in S4008c and subsequent state actions.[[cityandstateny+4]{.underline}](https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2025/02/here-are-key-dates-new-yorks-casino-licensing-timeline/402817/)​

## Status of Applications

-   **Application Deadline:** June 27, 2025 – All applications for casino licenses were due.[[nycasinos.ny+2]{.underline}](https://nycasinos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/06/06.27.24.gflb_timeline.pdf)​

-   **Applicants:** Eight major proposals were submitted, including major projects in Manhattan (Avenir, Caesars Palace Times Square, Freedom Plaza), Queens (Resorts World NYC at Aqueduct), Bronx (Bally’s), Brooklyn (Coney Island project), and Yonkers (MGM Empire City). Some projects, like Resorts World NYC and MGM Empire City, are racinos seeking full casino licenses.[[cbsnews+1]{.underline}](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/downstate-ny-casino-proposals/)​

-   **Community Advisory Committees (CACs):** Each proposal is being reviewed by a CAC for stakeholder and public input. CACs must hold meetings and public hearings; each must vote by September 30, 2025. Some votes have already been held, notably approving Yonkers (MGM Empire City) and Queens (Resorts World NYC) projects.[[cbsnews]{.underline}](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/downstate-ny-casino-proposals/)​

-   **Next Steps:** Projects approved by their CAC advance to the Gaming Facility Location Board (GFLB), which reviews supplemental applications and recommends up to three licenses to the State Gaming Commission.[[nyc+1]{.underline}](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/press-releases/2025/Casting%20the%20Dice%202025_VF.pdf)​

**Individual casino openings:**

-

-

    Once licenses are awarded (expected before the end of 2025), construction and renovation begin.

-

-

    Resorts World NYC (Queens) and MGM Empire City (Yonkers)—already operating as racinos—could have full casino operations within 6-12 months of license activation, potentially opening by late 2026 or early 2027.[[casinobeats+1]{.underline}](https://casinobeats.com/2025/11/03/resorts-world-nyc-mta-funding-pledge-casino-license-2025/)​

-

-

    New construction projects (Times Square, Coney Island, Bronx, etc.) will likely open in 2027 or later, depending on development complexity and local permitting.[[riverjournalonline+1]{.underline}](https://riverjournalonline.com/business/the-expansion-of-casinos-in-nyc-in-2025-what-you-need-to-know/263721/)​

## Additional Notes

-

-

    Delays are possible—some officials have warned that final awards could slide to early 2026.[[cdcgaming]{.underline}](https://cdcgaming.com/brief/new-york-senator-warns-casino-licenses-likely-delayed-until-2026/)​

-

-

    Successful applicants must complete local zoning, environmental reviews, and community engagement before license issuance.[[nyc+1]{.underline}](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/press-releases/2025/Casting%20the%20Dice%202025_VF.pdf)​

-

-

    The selection process is designed to maximize transparency and local benefit, per legislation requirements.[[nycasinos.ny+1]{.underline}](https://nycasinos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2024/06/06.27.24.gflb_timeline.pdf)​

-

In summary, by the end of 2025, up to three new downstate casino licenses will be awarded, with first openings likely in 2026-2027; racino conversions will be fastest to launch full casino operations.[[cicbca+6]{.underline}](https://cicbca.org/202407-countdown-begins-for-selecting-a-downstate-casino-gaming-site/)​
